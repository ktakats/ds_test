# Data Science Take Home Test

Here you can find my solution for the take home test.

There are two jupyter notebooks included, the Data exploration one and the Modeling one. I include a pdf version of both, too, just in case.

I used a virtual environment to run the code, the requirements.txt file contains all the dependencies you need to recreate the same environment.

The computer I used is quite powerful, it has 32 GB of RAM and 8 CPU cores, therefore some of the code might not work on a less powerful machine (I asked before the test if there was a minimum harware requirement).

Please let me know if you have any questions.
